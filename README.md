## Hi there 👋

My name is Alisa and I am a student interesting in learning more about the IT world!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal productivity web app.
- 🌱 I recently built a port scanner to get a better understanding on cyber security, check it out [here]https://github.com/AlsoLitmus/Port-Scanner
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects written in C++ and in Python.
