## Hi there 👋

My name is Alisa and I am a student interesting in learning more about the IT world!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal productivity web app.
- 🌱 I recently built a task management system to learn more about input validation and the use of a switch-case statement, check it out [here](https://github.com/AlsoLitmus/Tasks-Management-System-with-a-Menu)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects written in C++ and in Python. But expanding onto other languages would be cool as well.
